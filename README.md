Unit Converter App
Repository for Internship Task 1 at Oasis Infobyte

This repository contains the code for a Unit Converter application developed as part of the first task in my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The app allows users to convert various units of measurement including length, weight, temperature, and more. It features a user-friendly interface and supports multiple conversion categories.
